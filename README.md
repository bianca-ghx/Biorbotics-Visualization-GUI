## Who are we? 

## Project Information
The Advance Engineering Project is a compulsory subject from the Bachelor of Telecommunications Engineering and consists on designing and implementing a project requested by a company or some other entities related to the school.

This project is orientated to Biorobotics. Some activities performed by Cobots or other kind of robots that work with humans require the maximum precision feasible.

The main goal is to design and evaluate different kinds of capacity sensors based in proximity and evaluate matemathically the data obtained to extract conclusions and decide which is the better way to implement this technology.
