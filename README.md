# Biorbotics-Visualization-GUI
GUI for visualizing electronic and force &amp; distance measurements for biorobotics.

## Who are we? 

This code has been developed by Bianca Ghiorghiu and Raluca Nutu, for the Advanced Engineering Project (PAE) at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya. 

## Project Information
The Advanced Engineering Project is a compulsory subject from the Bachelor of Telecommunications Engineering and consists on designing and implementing a project requested by a company or some other entities related to the school.

This project is orientated to Biorobotics. Some activities performed by Cobots or other kind of robots that work with humans require the maximum precision feasible.

The goal of this project is to characterise nanomaterial samples and measure them, in the end using them to sense distance to a human body. Also we have a setup designed to measure force and distance. On the other hand, we had to develop a software in order to have an interface in which to see these results.

## Sponsorship 
This is an academic project which, as obvious, has no relationship with any company or business. The main sponsor of this project is the Barcelona School of Telecommunications Engineering (ETSETB) with the collaboration of Istituto di BioRobotica - Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna.
